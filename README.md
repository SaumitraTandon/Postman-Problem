# Delivering Letters in a City

This project implements a Q-learning agent to find the shortest path between the item packaging area and all other locations within a city, where the postman is allowed to travel. The postman's goal is to efficiently deliver letters to recipients by learning the shortest paths between locations.

## Environment

The environment consists of states, actions, and rewards. States are the possible locations within the city, including boundaries and aisles. Actions are movements (up, down, left, right), and rewards are defined based on the environment setup.

## Q-Learning

Q-learning is used to train the agent. The agent learns the Q-values for each state-action pair, aiming to maximize cumulative rewards. The epsilon-greedy strategy is used for action selection, balancing exploration and exploitation.

## Implementation

- The environment is represented as a grid with specified states, actions, and rewards.
- Q-values are initialized for each state-action pair.
- Training involves episodes where the agent selects actions, receives rewards, and updates Q-values.
- The agent learns the shortest path from any location to the item packaging area using Q-learning.

## Usage

1. Run the code to define the environment and Q-learning functions.
2. Train the agent by running the training loop for a specified number of episodes.
3. Use the `get_shortest_path(start_row, start_column)` function to find the shortest path from any location to the item packaging area.

## Example

```python
path = get_shortest_path(5, 2)  # Start at row 5, column 2
path.reverse()
print(path)
